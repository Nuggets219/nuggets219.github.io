I have no name for this game, nor really any sort of plan.
I just want to try to make a general purpose thing.
Maybe not even that, and just a weird little side project
using JS canvas.

I intend to use a table filled with Canvas elements to 
display lots of information at once.

Anyone can use this, no credit required.
Except for any assets I make, which will be pre/suff-
ixed by "NUG".
It's probably super simple anyways.
